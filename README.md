# Hopfield Network GPU

GPU version of [Hopfield_network](https://github.com/skrbcr/Hopfield_network). I also revised source code and rewrite it with Python (Jupyter).

## How to play

If you don't have gpu, please execute it with [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

- `AssocMem_Tutorial.ipynb`: Tutorial of Hopfield network and this module. When you run it, please put `AssocMem.py` in the same directory.
- `AssocMem.py`: Module of Hopfield network
- `compare_cpu_gpu.ipynb`: Comparison of exection time between CPU and GPU. You can experience the benefit of GPU.
